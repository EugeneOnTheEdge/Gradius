# Gradius
An arcade game developed in Java.

Compatible with both Windows and Mac. Download ALL the files and place them in the same directory then (on Windows) double-click RUN_GRADIUS.bat.

On Mac: open up Terminal, change directory (by using cd) to the game directory and type in:
# javac *.java && java Gradius

# How to play
1. [ARROW KEYS]/[W]/[A]/[S]/[D] to move!
2. [SPACEBAR] to shoot! Keep an eye on your bullets capacity though!
3. Hold [SHIFT] to move faster but it drains your fuel though.
4. You get a free bullet every 5 seconds.
5. Also free 1.5% fuel every 1.5 seconds!
6. The game gets harder every 10 seconds starting at 2500pts score mark, but you also get +15HP every 10 seconds!

# And last but not least: expect some bugs! Hahahaah

Enjoy!
